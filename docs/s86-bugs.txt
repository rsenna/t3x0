Bug list from Rugxulo

Limits
- IMKSPACE in source (S86.T) needs to be increased (512 -> 1536)
- all instructions must be lowercase ("mov")
- all hex numbers must be uppercase ("$0A")
- simple arithmetic isn't supported ("cmp byte myvar+2,0")

Missing Features
[FIXED] no errorlevel 1 on failure to assemble (and makes 0-byte .COM)
- lack of some instructions (LEA)
- unclear error messages ("bad operand(s)" ... what? where? how?)

Inefficiencies
- "MOV AX, ..." doesn't use the shorter form
- "INC DI" is two bytes instead of one

Bugs!
- ?? SUB silently turned into AND ??
- "MOV [BX+@var]" silently broken (but "CMP" works)
- "CMP b[mem],imm" is mysteriously turned into ADD
- "XOR [mem],imm" and "SUB [mem],imm" don't work
- line numbers in error reporting are (sometimes?) off by one, confusing
